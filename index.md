## [Levels of Abstraction](/levelsofabstraction) 

- Understand the motivation for different programming paradigms: to abstract machine operation into human understandable and composable programs
- Understand the difference between *syntax* the textual symbols and grammatical rules of a program, and *semantics* the meaning of what is computed
- Understand that there are different models of computation upon which different programming languages are based, including machine models such as Turing Machines and von Neumann architecture, and the Lambda Calculus based on mathematical functions.

## [Introduction to JavaScript](/javascript1)

- Understand and use basic JavaScript coding concepts and features
- Understand the difference between [mutable and immutable (const) variables](/javascript1#declaring-variables)
- Explain the relationship between javascript [functions](/javascript1#functions) and [objects](/javascript1#objects)
- Understand function scope and the concept of a [closure](/javascript1#closures)
- Create and apply [anonymous functions](/javascript1#anonymous-functions) to fluent style code
- Compare [arrow functions](/javascript1#arrow-functions) and regular function syntax
- Explain JavaScriptâ€™s [prototype mechanism](/javascript1#prototype-class-mechanism) for creating classes from functions
- Create [ES6 style classes](/javascript1#ecmascript-6-class-syntax) with constructors and getters
- Compare object oriented [polymorphism](/javascript1#polymorphism) to [dependency injection](/javascript1#dependency-injection) through functions

## [Functional JavaScript](/functionaljavascript)

* Create programs in JavaScript in a functional style
* Explain the role of pure functional programming style in managing side effects
* See how pure functions can be used to [model sophisticated computation](/functionaljavascript#computation-with-pure-functions)

## [Introduction to TypeScript](/typescript1)

- Create programs in TypeScript using types to ensure correctness at compile time.
- Explain how TypeScript features like Interfaces, Union Types and Optional Properties allow us to model types in common JavaScript coding patterns with precision.
- Explain how Generics allow us to create type safe but general and reusable code.
- Compare and contrast strongly, dynamically and gradually typed languages.
- Describe how compilers that support type inference assist us in writing type safe code.

## [Higher Order Functions](/higherorderfunctions)

- Understand that Higher-Order Functions are those which take other functions as input parameters or which return functions
- Understand that a Combinator is a higher-order function that uses only function application and earlier defined combinators to define a result from its arguments
- Use simple Combinator functions to manipulate and compose other functions

## [Lazy Evaluation](/lazyevaluation)

- Understand how functions can be used to delay evaluation of code until the result is actually required
- Understand how this *lazy* evaluation allows for the definition of *infinite sequences*
- Code and use lazily evaluated infinite number sequences

## [Functional Reactive Programming](/functionalreactiveprogramming)

- Understand that the Functional Reactive Programming Observable construct is just another container of elements, but whose "push-based" architecture allows them to be used to capture asynchronous behaviour
- Understand that Observables provide the benefits of functional programming: composability, reusability.
- See that Observables structure complex stateful programs in a more linear and understandable way that maps more easily to the underlying state machine.
- Use Observables to create simple UI programs in-place of asynchronous event handling.

## [Observable Asteroids](/asteroids)

A fully worked example of FRP using rx.js Observables to create an in-browser version of a classic arcade game.

## [Lambda Calculus](/lambdacalculus)

* Understand that the lambda calculus provides a complete model of computation
* Relate the lambda calculus to functional programming
* Apply conversion and reduction rules to simplify lambda expressions

## [From JavaScript to Haskell (via PureScript)](/purescript)

* Compare a lambda-calculus inspired Haskell-like language (PureScript) with the functional programming concepts explored earlier in JavaScript
* Understand how tail call optimisation is applied in languages which support it

## [Haskell 1](/haskell1)

## [Haskell 2](/haskell2)
