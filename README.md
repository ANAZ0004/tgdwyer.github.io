## Contributing

We use pre-commit to ensure code quality and consistency. To contribute, please follow these steps:

1. Install pre-commit:

   ```sh
   pip install pre-commit
   ```

2. Install the pre-commit hooks:

   ```sh
   pre-commit install
   ```

After this, the pre-commit hooks will run automatically on each commit to check for spelling and linting.
